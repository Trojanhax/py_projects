### Python Code Explanation:

```python
import qrcode as qr
from PIL import Image
```

- The code begins by importing the necessary libraries: `qrcode` for generating QR codes and `PIL` (Pillow) for working with images.

```python
# Create a QRCode object
qrc = qr.QRCode(
    version=1,
    error_correction=qr.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_H,
    box_size=10,
    border=4,
)
```

- Here, a `QRCode` object is created with specific parameters:
  - `version=1`: Sets the QR code version.
  - `error_correction=qr.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_H`: Specifies the error correction level (high).
  - `box_size=10`: Sets the size of each "box" or module in the QR code.
  - `border=4`: Defines the border size around the QR code.

```python
# Prompt the user for input
link = input('Enter your link: ')
```

- The code prompts the user to input a link and stores it in the `link` variable.

```python
# Add the data to the QR code
qrc.add_data(link)
qrc.make(fit=True)
```

- The user's input link is added to the `QRCode` object using `qrc.add_data(link)`, and `qrc.make(fit=True)` is called to generate the QR code data.

```python
# Create the QR code image
img = qrc.make_image(fill_color='red', back_color='green')
```

- The code generates a QR code image using the data from the `QRCode` object. It specifies the fill color as red and the background color as green.

```python
# Save the image to a file
img.save('you.png')
```

- Finally, the generated QR code image is saved as "you.png" in the current working directory.
